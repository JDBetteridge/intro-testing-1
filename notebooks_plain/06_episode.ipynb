      "source": "Unit tests are so called because they exercise the functionality of the code by interrogating individual functions and methods. Functions and methods can often be considered the atomic units of software because they are indivisible. However, what is considered to be the smallest code unit is subjective. The body of a function can be long are short, and shorter functions are arguably more unit-like than long ones.\n\nThus what reasonably constitutes a code unit typically varies from project to project and language to language. A good guideline is that if the code cannot be made any simpler logically (you cannot split apart the addition operator) or practically (a function is self-contained and well defined), then it is a unit."

Functions, generally, shouldn’t be longer than paragraphs. Robert C. Martin, the author of “Clean Code” said : “The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.”"

To run these test functions, a test framework is often required to collect them together. For now, we’ll write some tests for the mean function and simply run them individually to see whether they fail. In the next session, we’ll use a test framework to collect and run them."

      "source": "## Unit Tests Are Just Functions\nUnit tests are typically made of three pieces, some set-up, a number of assertions, and some tear-down. Set-up can be as simple as initializing the input values or as complex as creating and initializing concrete instances of a class. Ultimately, the test occurs when an assertion is made, comparing the observed and expected values. For example, let us test that our mean function successfully calculates the known value for a simple list.\n\nIn ipython run the following:\n```python\nIn [1]: from mean import *\n\nIn [2]: def test_ints():\n   ...:    num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n   ...:    obs = mean(num_list)\n   ...:    exp = 3.0\n   ...:    assert obs == exp\n   ...:\n```\n\nThe test above:\n\n- sets up the input parameters (the simple list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n- collects the observed result\n- declares the expected result (calculated with our human brain).\n- and compares the two with an assertion.\n\nRun the test as you would any other function:\n```python\nIn [3]: test_ints()\n```\n\nWhat output do you expect to see?"
